# # Single Number

# Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one. Find that single number. You may assume that there will _always_ be _one_ odd-number-out and every other number in the input shows up exactly twice.  

# ## Examples
# ```
# Sample input: [2, 2, 1]
# Expected output: 1
# ```

# ```
# Sample iput: [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
# Expected output: 4
# ```

# Can you implement a solution that finds the single number in _one_ pass through the input array with `O(1)` space complexity?

# ## Testing
# Run the test file by executing `python test_single_number.py`.
